  summary: Create a JWT token for subsequent requests
  description: >
    Post in the user name and password credentionals to receive a JWT token to
    be used for authentication.

    Once you have done this and received the token place this token in the
    "Authorize" section at the top right of the page to authenticate all the
    calls that use the JWT token.

    The token will last for 24 hours after which a new token will need to be
    generated
